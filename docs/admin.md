# PenguinUpload - Administration

If you are hosting a PenguinUpload instance, it is a good idea
to know how to perform basic administration tasks.

Since PenguinUpload is a file hosting service, running an instance
with public registration will almost certainly result in spam
and other unwanted activity.

The Admin features of PenguinUpload are accessed entirely through the
REST API, and there are only a few admin-specific routes. Once you (the administrator)
have selected target users, you can access the user-specific API by
impersonating the users by using their API keys.
